# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



<!-- note the folder structure -->
<!-- in src, assets will use images and like so -->
<!-- in src, lib uses additional classes/helpers like api requests are defined there -->
<!-- in src, pages are consumers basically pages like Home.jsx Cart.jsx will defined there -->
<!-- any small components like buttons and inputs are defined in the components section -->
<!-- components section may have additional folders like components/home/[all home components will go here] -->
<!-- In components too, we use a library called shadcn, you can use import and use inputs, buttons and other components from there, for some scenarios, you may use and define a custom made components.  -->
<!-- styles... css -->
<!-- store is for global state management(for the most part you can forget about that) -->
